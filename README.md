# Aman-Graduation-Project-
Building an AMAN  application is the final stage of the driver drowsiness detection system. In the beginning, AMAN application will turn on when gets an alarm notification from the other two subsystems. But actually, this step is not completed in our project because of coronavirus's circumstance.
The application initially generates a random number to be the index of equations’ array. This array includes simple mathematical equations, the application will write the equation on the screen and use text to speech feature to make the driver’s  Android device read the equation and convert it to audio out via the speaker.
After that, the application will be freezing until the driver clicks on anywhere on the App’s screen to allow it to listen to the driver's sound. this approach comes to protect the driver's privacy. Then the app will recognize and analyze the driver's sound. the application will use speech Recognizer Intent to get the driver's answer.
The last stage is to verify the driver's answer. by comparing the default equation's answer with the driver's answer. If the driver answers correctly, the application will close itself. Otherwise,  the application will turn on an alarm and it will not turn off until the driver's answer be correct
